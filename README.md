sudoku-like puzzle:

- 8 different symbols
- non orthogonal grid (a zonohedron, possibly a rhombicuboctahedron)
- grid has 40 cells
- the constraints per cell are slightly different:
    - there are 6 symmetrical petals, with 8 cells each - on each petal, all the 8 symbols must appear once
    - there are N "arms", with 8 cells each - on each arm, all the 8 symbols must appear once (how many?)
